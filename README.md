## Introducing MIXED Lang

**MIXED Lang (Multi-Information X Enhanced Dynamic Language)** is a new programming language which contains features from every programming language that existed today. The MIXED Lang allows you to make your programm dynamically. 

The MIXED Lang compiler is based on Python 3, which makes it much easier to maintain.

## To Get Started

It is easy to get started with MIXED Lang in case you are specialized in all of the fields listed below:

- Python developing
- C/C++ developing
- Java developing
- HTML developing
- js developing
- PHP developing

If not, you can get started with MIXED Lang with a little bit preparation. You will have to learn some basic stuff by following these steps:

1. Open [Google](https://google.com/) in your browser. (If you're not able to open it, use Bing instead is also OK.)
2. Find an input box in the middle of your screen.
3. Type `How to learn 6 programming languages in a month` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
4. Look at the first result and take actions. No matter it seems helpful or not.
5. If you're still looking at this line, please continue learning the listed languages. Once you finish learning them, you can continue getting started with MIXED Lang.

### Too busy to prepare by learning 6 languages?

## Usage

As we have told, MIXED Lang's compiler is based on Python 3. So you should use Python 3 to compile your MIXED Lang code with the following command:

```bash
<python | python3> mixed.py <<filename>.mixed>
```
